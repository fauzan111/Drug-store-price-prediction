# Drug-store-price-prediction
This project focuses on analyzing sales data for Rossmann, a major German drugstore chain with a strong presence across Europe. Using an open-source dataset provided by Rossmann, the objective is to gain insights that can enhance the companyâ€™s decision-making and operational strategies. 

Key areas of analysis include understanding overall sales trends and evaluating the effectiveness of promotional activities, particularly during holidays. The project will also examine the impact of different types of promotions on sales performance and explore the benefits of opening new stores near competitors. 

The findings will provide Rossmann with actionable recommendations to optimize their sales strategies and strengthen their competitive position in the market.
